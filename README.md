## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Celery Crunch, a second-year student from Nait. I am learning to become a web developer for my future career, and I am very excited to share what I have going on with my fellow GitHub followers. Iâ€™m currently learning to use WordPress and learning all kinds of things in my web developer class. I love hiking and love playing all kinds of sports. My favorite sport is Volleyball. I also love playing games. Currently, my favorite game is Fortnite. If anyone is interested in queuing up sometime after a long day of coding, I'd love to play together!
